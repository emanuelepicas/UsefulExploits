### JWT authentication bypass via weak signing key

 brute-force the website's secret key. Once you've obtained this, use it to sign a modified session token that gives you access
 
 Try to brute force it like this
 
 hashcat -a 0 -m 16500 <YOUR-JWT> /path/to/jwt.secrets.list

Once you luckily find the key, generate a new simmetric key and place in "k": {key | base64} and save it.
On the tab for the exstension JWK, press sign the JWT.

Sample of command:


:~/# hashcat -a 0 -m 16500 eyJraWQiOiJhNjQ0MWI5MC1kZmJlLTRmNGQtOWNiZS02MjdjMDJlZTVkOGEiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJpc3MiOiJwb3J0c3dpZ2dlciIsInN1YiI6IndpZW5lciIsImV4cCI6MTY2MzA5MzExOX0.-kfw_e-EjpnQnkq3tmqJkTZAQWKA3Us5NOP1EEs_Y5Q jwt.secrets.list

### Another way to exploit through JWT
  
 * JWT authentication bypass via kid header path traversal *
 
Generate a new simmetric key but at the value "k" insert a NULL string base64 encoded AA== => 0000

Before sending the request sign the JWT with the new key and insert into the kid:"" the path traversal that you want to aim 

  this will make a match because the null key will point to the null section as follow ../../../dev/null
  
 ### JWT authentication bypass via jwk header injection
  
  Click New RSA Key
  Generate to automatically generate a new key pair, then click OK to save the key. Note that you don't need to select a key size as this will automatically be updated later.
  At the bottom of the JSON Web Token tab, click Attack, then select Embedded JWK. When prompted, select your newly generated RSA key and click OK.

In the header of the JWT, observe that a jwk parameter has been added containing your public key.
  
 ### JWT authentication bypass via jku header injection
  
  Click New RSA Key.

In the dialog, click Generate to automatically generate a new key pair, then click OK to save the key. Note that you don't need to select a key size as this will automatically be updated later.

In the browser, go to the exploit server.

Replace the contents of the Body section with an empty JWK Set as follows:

{
    "keys": [

    ]
}
Back on the JWT Editor Keys tab, right-click on the entry for the key that you just generated, then select Copy Public Key as JWK.

Paste the JWK into the keys array on the exploit server, then store the exploit. The result should look something like this:

{
    "keys": [
        {
            "kty": "RSA",
            "e": "AQAB",
            "kid": "893d8f0b-061f-42c2-a4aa-5056e12b8ae7",
            "n": "yy1wpYmffgXBxhAUJzHHocCuJolwDqql75ZWuCQ_cb33K2vh9mk6GPM9gNN4Y_qTVX67WhsN3JvaFYw"
        }
    ]
}
  
  
  Add a new jku parameter to the header of the JWT. Set its value to the URL of your JWK Set on the exploit server.
  
  This will allow you to load into the admin panel
