Usually the exam has these three stages to overcome

1. Obtain access to a non-privileged user (stealing the cookie session most of the time, XSS, DOM XSS, Reflected XSS, Cache injection ecc)
2. Escalate your privileges to administrator (not with a simple usename=administrator, but a little bit more complex (SQLi,CLickjacking ecc.)
3. Read the content of the /home/carlos/secret (command injection, path trasversal, template injection ecc.)

# Tips:
Run scan as soon you start the exam, sometimes scan can enumerate vulnerabilities and help you, other times not (false Positive)
Be aware of rabbit hole, think as James Kettle and he's book


*Think before you lanch a command - DON'T BE A SCRIPT KIDDLE*


*Think out of the box - ALWAYS*
