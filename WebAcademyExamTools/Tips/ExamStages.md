## Stages

Stage 1: Access any user account.
Stage 2: Use the compromised user account to access the admin inteface, perhaps by elevating your privileges or compromising the administrator account.
Stage 3: Use the admin interface to read the contents of /home/carlos/secret from the server's filesystem, and submit it using 'submit solution'.

If you find an SSRF vulnerability, you can use it to read the files by accessing an internal-only service running on locahost(127.0.0.1/127.1) on port 6566.

## Tips:
Run scan as soon you start the exam, sometimes scan can enumerate vulnerabilities and help you, other times not (false Positive)
Be aware of rabbit hole, think as James Kettle and he's book

First step:
Find Comment,Find Script, Active Scan, Discovery Scan
/robots.txt
/cgi-bin/phpinfo.php
/.git
.git/logs/refs/heads/master (here you see the last two commits) run $wget --recursive $git diff 

*Think before you lanch a command - DON'T BE A SCRIPT KIDDLE*


*Think out of the box - ALWAYS*

TRACE METHOD sometime on admin

### Forecast of the vulnerability on each stage:

*Objective for Stage 1: Get any user access*
Description: Black box pentest of the application to gain access to authenticated application via one user
Examples:

```
SQL Injection
Cross-Site Scripting
Authentication / Credentials Brute force
Request Smuggling
Web Cache Poisoning
```


*Objective for Stage 2: Get Admin access*
Description: Any vulnerabilities leveraged features only accessible via authenticated user or privilege escalation to administrator

Examples:

```
SQL Injection
Cross-Site Scripting
Cross Site Request Forgery
HTTP host header attacks
Server-Side Request Forgery
Access Control vulnerabilities
Authentication / Credentials Brute force
```

*Objective for Stage 3: Read Contents of ‘/home/carlos/secret’*
Description: Any vulnerabilities that can execute code on the server or read files on the server
Examples:


```
XML External Entities
SQL Injection
Command Injection
Server-Side Template Injection
Path Traversal
File Upload attacks
Insecure Deserialization
```
