# Access control vulnerabilities

## Description

Access control (or authorization) is the application of constraints on who (or what) can perform attempted 
actions or access resources that they have requested. In the context of web applications, access control is 
dependent on authentication and session management:

Authentication identifies the user and confirms that they are who they say they are.
Session management identifies which subsequent HTTP requests are being made by that same user.
Access control determines whether the user is allowed to carry out the action that they are attempting to perform.
Broken access controls are a commonly encountered and often critical security vulnerability. Design and management 
of access controls is a complex and dynamic problem that applies business, organizational, and legal constraints 
to a technical implementation. Access control design decisions have to be made by humans, not technology, and 
the potential for errors is high.

From a user perspective, access controls can be divided into the following categories:

Vertical access controls
Horizontal access controls
Context-dependent access controls

### Unprotected admin funtionality

```
Go to the lab and view robots.txt by appending /robots.txt to the lab URL. Notice that the Disallow line discloses the path to the admin panel.
In the URL bar, replace /robots.txt with /administrator-panel to load the admin panel.
Delete carlos.
```

### Unprotected admin functionality with unpredictable URL

```
Review the lab home page's source using Burp Suite or your web browser's developer tools.
Observe that it contains some JavaScript that discloses the URL of the admin panel.
Load the admin panel and delete carlos.
```
### User role controllled by request parameter (try it you never know)

```
Browse to /admin and observe that you can't access the admin panel.
Browse to the login page.
In Burp Proxy, turn interception on and enable response interception.
Complete and submit the login page, and forward the resulting request in Burp.
Observe that the response sets the cookie Admin=false. Change it to Admin=true.
Load the admin panel and delete carlos.

Cookie: Admin=false; session=tXWmkuiLhLSis8ZYogBjWR9RmLkARsrB
```
### User role can be modified  in user profile

```
Log in using the supplied credentials and access your account page.
Use the provided feature to update the email address associated with your account.
Observe that the response contains your role ID.
Send the email submission request to Burp Repeater, add "roleid":2 into the JSON in the request body, and resend it.
Observe that the response shows your roleid has changed to 2.
Browse to /admin and delete carlos.
```
### User ID controlled by request parameter

```
Log in using the supplied credentials and go to your account page.
Note that the URL contains your username in the "id" parameter.
Send the request to Burp Repeater.
Change the "id" parameter to carlos.
Retrieve and submit the API key for carlos.
```

### User ID controlled by request parameter, with unpredictable user IDs (search for a string into the pages)

```
Find a blog post by carlos.
Click on carlos and observe that the URL contains his user ID. Make a note of this ID.
Log in using the supplied credentials and access your account page.
Change the "id" parameter to the saved user ID.
Retrieve and submit the API key.
```
### User ID controlled by request parameter with data leakage in redirect

```
Find a blog post by carlos.
Click on carlos and observe that the URL contains his user ID. Make a note of this ID.
Log in using the supplied credentials and access your account page.
Change the "id" parameter to the saved user ID.
Retrieve and submit the API key.

HTTP/1.1 302 Found
Location: /login
Content-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8
Cache-Control: no-cache
Connection: close
Content-Length: 3718
```

### User ID controlled by request parameter with data leakage in redirect

```
Log in using the supplied credentials and access the user account page.
Change the "id" parameter in the URL to administrator.
View the response in Burp and observe that it contains the administrator's password.
Log in to the administrator account and delete carlos.
```

### Insecure direct object references

```
Select the Live chat tab.
Send a message and then select View transcript.
Review the URL and observe that the transcripts are text files assigned a filename containing an incrementing number.
Change the filename to 1.txt and review the text. Notice a password within the chat transcript.
Return to the main lab page and log in using the stolen credentials.
```

### URL-based access control can be circunvented (admin)

```
Try to load /admin and observe that you get blocked. Notice that the response is very plain, suggesting it may originate from a front-end system.
Send the request to Burp Repeater. Change the URL in the request line to / and add the HTTP header X-Original-URL: /invalid. Observe that the application returns a "not found" response. This indicates that the back-end system is processing the URL from the X-Original-URL header.
Change the value of the X-Original-URL header to /admin. Observe that you can now access the admin page.
To delete the user carlos, add ?username=carlos to the real query string, and change the X-Original-URL path to /admin/delete.
```

### Method-based access control can be circunvented

```
Log in using the admin credentials.
Browse to the admin panel, promote carlos, and send the HTTP request to Burp Repeater.
Open a private/incognito browser window, and log in with the non-admin credentials.
Attempt to re-promote carlos with the non-admin user by copying that user's session cookie into the existing Burp Repeater request, and observe that the response says "Unauthorized".
Change the method from POST to POSTX and observe that the response changes to "missing parameter".
Convert the request to use the GET method by right-clicking and selecting "Change request method".
Change the username parameter to your username and resend the request.
```

### Multi-step process with no access control on one step

```
Log in using the admin credentials.
Browse to the admin panel, promote carlos, and send the confirmation HTTP request to Burp Repeater.
Open a private/incognito browser window, and log in with the non-admin credentials.
Copy the non-admin user's session cookie into the existing Repeater request, change the 
username to yours, and replay it.
```

### Referer-based access control

```
Log in using the admin credentials.
Browse to the admin panel, promote carlos, and send the HTTP request to Burp Repeater.
Open a private/incognito browser window, and log in with the non-admin credentials.
Browse to /admin-roles?username=carlos&action=upgrade and observe that the request is treated as 
unauthorized due to the absent Referer header.
Copy the non-admin user's session cookie into the existing Burp Repeater request, change the 
username to yours, and replay it.
```
