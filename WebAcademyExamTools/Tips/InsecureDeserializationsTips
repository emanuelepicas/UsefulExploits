Insecure Deserialization Tips / Information Disclosure

Look at the cookie session, sometimes you can modified value inside to get privelege escaltion or you can exploit the back-end language system.
An example could be with PHP vulnerabilities, when it compares string with 0 number https://medium.com/swlh/php-type-juggling-vulnerabilities-3e28c4ed5c09


In other cases you need to use gadject chain in order to make some action into the Back-end
Using some repository such as:

https://github.com/ambionics/phpggc for PHP

https://github.com/frohoff/ysoserial for JAVA deserialization

Or even with Ruby

In other scenario, try to use TRACE to see all header used by the request, here you can find some hidden header useful

Take a look into ../.git
Sometimes lanch git diff 00a0s.. 990aòòò to see if there is some credentials leak, you can have a look in the file .git/logs/HEAD or similar
